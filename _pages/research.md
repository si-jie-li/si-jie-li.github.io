title: "Ambitious is not the same as impossible"
---
From an early age, I believe there must be reasons for everything existing and want to totally understand them. However, to figure all of them out, unless, I have infinite time. Thus, I dream of achiving longevity even immortal, so that I can have enough time to fulfill my curiosity by exploring the science of nature. 

After enter university, I realize that I can achieve this by research besides just living a healthy lifestyle. From then on, I start my chasing toward my dream in an academic way. I have shifted among several different directions after reflections, but all for the same intention -- understand and deal with senescence!

All I know from the first point is that senescence is quite a complex thing and dealing with it requires interdisciplinary knowledge and solid foundation, so I keep on going all out in every courses to maximize my knowledge and skill resevoir (That's why my grade looks nice :slightly_smiling_face:).

Here is my chasing trajectory after I enter university: 

- **[Select BME](#1)**
- **[Start from Anti-aging drug](#5)**  
    Experience in [Zhiluo](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=luoz&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2&lang=en)'s lab -- polymer synthesis and cell culture
- **[Turn to computational methods](#2)**  
    machine learning and AIDD
- **[Turmoil in seeking for first-principle methods](#3)**  
    Experience in [Chris Soon Heng Tan](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=christan&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2&lang=en)â€™s Lab -- proteomics
- **[Combine theoretical and computational methods](#6)**  
    Experience in [Juliu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=liuj36&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2)'s lab -- fluid-structure interaction for vascular modeling
- **[Determine research focus...](#4)**

<h2 id="1">Select BME</h2>
In SUSTech, we have not determine our major during the first. To figure out which major can equip me with the most related skills and knowledge to achieve my dream, I have appointed and consulted many professors, mainly within the Biology and Biomedical Engineering deparment. After getting the ideas what these majors focus on, I selected BME to **deal with senescence from an engineering perspective**, which, in my opinion then, focuses on finding solutions while the biology guys focuses on figuring out the mechanisms.

During the consulting, I get a rough idea that there are a lot of compensation mechanisms in biology. This buried a seed for me to turn to systems biology later. 

*<small>BTW, the professor introduce this just want me not to be so idealized in research. During the chasing process, I keep on consulting professor for advise and "not to be so idealized", "it is impossible", "why do you want this" is what I mostly get. :persevere:</small>*

<h2 id="5">Start from Anti-aging drug</h2>
Only few professors showed encouraging attitude after hearing my dream of immortal, and my mentor Zhiluo is one of them. He instructed me to start from synthesis polymer dealing with diseases related to senescence, like calcification. To contribute to the anti-aging research as soon as possible, I enter his lab to learn the skills related to **polymer synthesis, characterization, and cell culturing**. Everything in the labotary is quite new to me, and to get familiar of them, I both reviewed every details I learned and self-learn the principles behind techniques. Meanwhile, I requently audit the group meeting to learn the works of other senior members, absorb the research principle instructed by professor, and have a general idea of how a lab run.

*<font color=grey><small>My lab.log. I was taught to culture the cell like my own child, and you can not imagine how exciting I was when I successfully culture my "child" clean and healthy at my first trial, which is challenging for most of green hands.</small></font>*

However, during the first summer, senior apprentice was too busy to tutorial me on many of the labotary skill, and I utilized the spare time diving into the book *Ageless*, which led to my thought shifting.

<h2 id="2">Turn to computational methods</h2>
In the last chapter of *Ageless*'s "Treating ageing" part, the author indicates the complexity of aging calls for solving aging problem using computational methods from a holistic perspective, which, for me, is the most inspiring point given by the book. I go through the [reference link](https://andrewsteele.co.uk/ageless/references/) to find more informative details about aging and, most importantly, find out what people have done with computational methods. And it was my first time to know we have already been able to build a [Whole-Cell Computational Model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412007763?via%3Dihub)!

At the same time, I was worried about the low efficiency, long period, and heavily cost of the wet lab experiments (since I want to achieve immortal before death:worried:). I keep on thinking and exploring a more effective way toward my dream.

At the end of the first sophomore semester, after reflection and inspired by *Ageless*, I generate a vague idea to build a model for we human, which enables us to know how a human react to an input drug or treatment. This model should take in those complementary mechanisms into account and think of the whole human holistically. (Later when I read more literatures, I am so exciting to know that many researchers are just devoted into it!)

 I tried to explain my immature thought to my mentor and he recommended me to learn about **AIDD** (AI drug design), which is also a project he focuses on.

I then spent my winter holiday self-learned machine learning, basic probability and statistics, and the AIDD work. I also enjoyed [Machine Learring and Its Medical Engineering Applications course](/courses#1) in the following semester. 

><small>I use a paper oriented way to self-learned AIDD work, which means I check up every new concept in the paper and try to replicate the code myself. During the process, I learn how to represent molecular structure in SMILES code along with mostly used computational packages and algorithm principles behind them, including, one-hot encoding, max pooling, zero padding, etc..</small>

However, the more I learned about machine learning, my worry towards its data-driven property stronger, and the uninterpretabe "black box" just give me sense of uncertainty. Maybe due to my characteristics (always want to seek the fundamental laws behind things), I decided to equip myself with first-principle methods before turning to data-driven simulation.

<h2 id="3">Turmoil in seeking for first-principle methods</h2>

>Since from a single cell to the whole human being, everything is consist of substance. So if I can understand the law of substances, I can digitally describe all the substance derived.

Seems quite naive and idealized, but this is what I thought when I applied to transfer my major to Chemistry at the end of my sophomore year. At the same stage, I contacted professor Chris Soon Heng Tan, whose research direction, to my mind that time, combines data-driven and first-principle methods. I got the opportunity to closely learned proteomic wet lab experiment technique and dry lab analysis in his group. 

I really appreciate and cherish this opportunities. I spent all my available time of 2024 summer holiday staying in the lab, consulting every senior members of their research project, learning proteomic techniques detail (including SILAC, Western Blot, SISPROT, CETSA, TPCA, etc.), and reading literatures. Through this intensive learning, I have equipped myself with many critical research skills.

That summer, I get to know the concept of "emergent phenomenon" and "complex system" for the first time in PEBBLE biocamp of Westlake University, and again, brought my mind to another level.

<h2 id="6">Combine theoretical and computational methods</h2>
Due to my personal increasing barrier to chemical experiments, I felt extremely uncomfortable and anxious after the compulsary lab courses, and thus, was forced to withdraw the major transferring application along with the leaving from professor Chris's lab.

At the same time, inspired by the PEBBLE biocamp, I took Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics out of passion (And got A+ at the end, which again proves that I have the ability to do well in what I want to do :blush:). 

Again, reflecting on the path towards my dream, I start my third research in Juliu's lab to learn model vasculature under mechanical principle and computational tool. (This is integrated design project offered by Engineering college which can serve as my graduation project.) Though this kind of simulation is mesoscale level and from a mechanical perspective, I aim to get a taste of combining theory and computation, and grasp useful computational skills and principle of modeling.

*<font color=grey><small>The cylinder and aorta mesh I build up using Gmsh and the FSI (Fluid-Structure Interaction) simulation result of the cylinder. </small></font>*

I get the hang of the pipline to carry out FSI simulation and be more familiar with linux, usage of cluster, and parallel computation. Besides techniques, I also self-learned basic biomechanis and FEM (finite element method) principle.

Also, I gradually realize that most of the time, it is not neccesary and also impossible to build up the model 100% correct. **In my opinion, modeling is to use those known laws to lower information entropy of the obtained data and then get the accurate information we want.**

Recently, I have joined an iGEM team and take on the reponsiblity to build up Individual-based models of microenvironment in order to prove the specific adhesion of Engineered E.coli in tumor microenvironment.

<h2 id="4">Determine research focus...</h2>
After the above exploration, I have gradually figure out the path towards my dream. Starting simulation from cellular level and scale it up, combining machine learning and understanding of physical laws, integrating multi-scale and multi-modal data, and developing of universal representations and experimental systems are what I want to focus on. 

I will take research as my lifetime career to fulfill my dream. My focus may still seem to be too broad and I really appreciate if you have any suggestions, guidance, or even opportunities for me. Thank you for your time to go through my story!
