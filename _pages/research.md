title: "Ambitious is Not the Same as Impossible"
---
From an early age, **I have been believing that everything must have a reason for existing**, and I wanted to fully understand those reasons. However, to figure everything out, unless I had infinite time, seemed impossible. Thus, I dream of achieving longevity, or even immortality, so that **I can have enough time to satisfy my curiosity** by exploring the science of nature.

After entering university, I realized that I can achieve this through research, besides just living a healthy lifestyle. From then on, I began pursuing my dream in an academic way. Over time, I have shifted between several different directions, but all with the same intention – to understand and combat senescence!

All I know from the first point is that senescence is quite a complex thing and dealing with it requires interdisciplinary knowledge and solid foundation. So I keep on going all out in every courses to maximize my knowledge and skill reservoir (That's why my grades look nice :slightly_smiling_face:).

Here is the trajectory of my journey after I entered university: 

- **[Select BME](#1)**
- **[Start from Anti-aging drug](#5)**  
    Experience in [Zhi Luo](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=luoz&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2&lang=en){:target="_blank"}'s lab -- polymer synthesis and cell culturing
- **[Turn to computational methods](#2)**  
    machine learning and AIDD
- **[Turmoil in seeking first-principle methods](#3)**  
    Experience in [Chris Soon Heng Tan](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=christan&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2&lang=en){:target="_blank"}’s Lab -- proteomics
- **[Combine theoretical and computational methods](#6)**  
    Experience in [Ju Liu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=liuj36&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2){:target="_blank"}'s lab -- fluid-structure interaction for vascular modeling
- **[Determine research focus...](#4)**

<h2 id="1">Select BME</h2>
At SUSTech, we don’t select a major in the first year. To figure out which major can equip me with the most relavant skills and knowledge to achieve my dream, I consulted with several professors, primarily from the Biology and Biomedical Engineering departments. After learning about the focus of these majors, I chose BME, which, in my opinion then, addresses senescence **from an engineering perspective** to find solutions, while biology focuses on uncovering the mechanisms.

During these consultations, I got a rough idea that biology involves many compensatory mechanisms. This buried a seed for me to turn to systems biology later. 

*<small>BTW, the professor introduce this just want me not to be so idealized in research. Throughout my journey, I kept consulting professors for advice, and the most common feedback I received was, “Don’t be so idealistic,” “It’s impossible,” and “Why do you want this?” :persevere:</small>*

<h2 id="5">Start from Anti-aging drug</h2>
Only a few professors were encouraging when I shared my dream of immortality, and my mentor Zhi Luo was one of them. He guided me to start with polymer synthesis for diseases related to senescence, like calcification. To contribute to anti-aging research as soon as possible, I joined his lab to learn **polymer synthesis, characterization, and cell culturing**. Everything in the lab was new to me, so I reviewed every detail I learned and self-taught the principles behind the techniques. I also frquently audited group meetings to learn about the researches of senior members, absorbed the research principles taught by the professor, and got a general idea of how a lab run.

*<font color=grey><small>My lab.log. I was taught to culture cells as if they were my own children, and you can imagine how excited I was when I successfully cultured my “child” cleanly and healthily on my first try, which is challenging for most of green hands.</small></font>*

However, during the first summer, the senior apprentice was too busy to mentor me on many laboratory skills. So, I used my spare time to dive into the book ***Ageless***, which shifted my thinking.

<h2 id="2">Turn to computational methods</h2>
I followed the [references](https://andrewsteele.co.uk/ageless/references/){:target="_blank"} in the book to explore more details about aging and, most importantly, discovered that we’ve already been able to build a [Whole-Cell Computational Model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412007763?via%3Dihub){:target="_blank"}!

At the same time, I was worried about the inefficiency, long duration, and high cost of wet lab experiments (since I want to achieve immortality before I die :worried:). I keep on thinking and exploring a more effective way toward my dream.

At the end of my first sophomore semester, reflecting on the ideas in *Ageless*, I generate a vague idea to build a model for we human, which enables us to know how a human respond to an input drug or treatment. This model should take in those complementary mechanisms into account and think of the whole human holistically. (Later when I read more literatures, I am so excited to know that many researchers are just devoted into it!)

I tried to explain my immature thought to my mentor and he recommended me to learn about **AIDD** (AI Drug Design), which is a project he is also working on.

I then spent my winter holiday teaching myself machine learning, basic probability and statistics, and AIDD. I also enjoyed [Machine Learring and Its Medical Engineering Applications course](/courses#5){:target="_blank"} in the following semester. 

><small>I used a paper-oriented approach to self-learn AIDD, which meant I looked up every new concept in the papers and tried to replicate the code myself. During this process, I learned how to represent molecular structures in SMILES code along with mostly used computational packages and algorithm principles behind them, including, one-hot encoding, max pooling, zero padding, and more.</small>

However, the more I learned about machine learning, the more concerned I became with its data-driven nature. **The “black box” nature of machine learning algorithms just gave me a sense of uncertainty**. Maybe due to my characteristics (always want to seek the fundamental laws behind things), I decided to equip myself with first-principle methods before diving into data-driven simulations.

<h2 id="3">Turmoil in seeking for first-principle methods</h2>

Since everything, from a single cell to the entire human body, is composed of substances, I thought that if I could understand the laws of substances, I could digitally describe all the substances derived from them.
{: .notice}

It may have seemed naive and idealized, but that’s what I thought when I **applied to transfer to a Chemistry major** at the end of my sophomore year. At the same stage, I contacted professor Chris Soon Heng Tan, whose research direction, to my mind that time, combines data-driven and first-principle methods. I got the opportunity to closely learn proteomic wet lab experiment technique and dry lab analysis in his group. 

I really appreciate and cherish this opportunities. I spent all my available time of 2024 summer holiday staying in the lab, consulting every senior members of their research projects, learning proteomic technique details (including SILAC, Western Blot, SISPROT, CETSA, TPCA, etc.), and reading literatures. This intensive learning equipped me with many critical research skills.

That summer, I get to know the concept of **"emergent phenomenon" and "complex system"** for the first time in PEBBLE biocamp of Westlake University, and again, brought my mind to another level.

<h2 id="6">Combine theoretical and computational methods</h2>
Due to increasing personal mental barrier to chemical experiments, I felt extremely uncomfortable and anxious after the compulsory lab courses, and thus, was forced to withdraw the application for major transfer along with the leaving from professor Chris's lab.

At the same time, inspired by the PEBBLE BioFusion Camp, I took *Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics* out of pure interest (And got A+ at the end, which again proves that I have the ability to do well in what I want to do :blush:). 

Reflecting once more on the path to my dream, I start my third research in Ju Liu's lab, where I studied vascular models under mechanical principles using computational tools.  (This is integrated design project offered by Engineering college which can serve as my graduation project.) Although this kind of simulation focuses on mesoscopic scale and mechanical aspects, my goal is to experience the integration of theory and computation, and to master useful computational skills and modeling principles.

*<font color=grey><small>The cylinder and aorta mesh I build up using Gmsh, and the FSI (Fluid-Structure Interaction) simulation result of the cylinder. </small></font>*

I became proficient in the pipeline for conducting FSI simulations, and grew more familiar with linux, high-performance clusters, and parallel computating.  In addition to technical skills, I self-studied basic biomechanics and principles of the Finite Element Method (FEM).

Gradually, I came to realize that in most cases, it is neither necessary nor possible to build 100% correct models. **In my view, modeling is about applying known laws to reduce the information entropy of collected data—thereby extracting the meaningful insights we seek.**

Recently, I have joined an iGEM team and took on the reponsiblity of **constructing individual-based models** of the tumor microenvironment to simulate the specific adhesion of engineered E. coli using CompuCell3D and PhysiCell.

<h2 id="4">Determine research focus...</h2>
After the above exploration, I have gradually figure out the path towards my dream. Starting from simulations at the cellular and organoid levels, combining **first-principles and artificial intelligence**, and integrating **multi-scale and multi-modal data**, I want to contribute to the e**stablishment and validation of universal representations and virtual instruments**. (This is also inspired by [the Perspective article on AI virtual cell](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.11.015){:target="_blank"})

I will take research as my lifetime career to fulfill my dream. My focus may still seem to be too broad and I really appreciate if you have any suggestions, guidance, or even opportunities for me. Thank you for your time to go through my story!
