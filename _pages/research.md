title: "Ambitious is Not the Same as Impossible"
---
From an early age, **I have always believed that everything must have a reason for existing**, and I wanted to fully understand those reasons. However, to figure everything out, unless I had infinite time, seemed impossible. Thus, I dream of achieving longevity, or even immortality, so that **I can have enough time to satisfy my curiosity** by exploring the science of nature.

After entering university, I realized that I can achieve this through research, besides just living a healthy lifestyle. From then on, I began pursuing my dream in an academic way. Over time, I have shifted between several different directions, but all with the same intention – to understand and combat senescence!

All I know from the first point is that senescence is quite a complex thing and dealing with it requires interdisciplinary knowledge and solid foundation. So I keep going all out in every course to maximize my knowledge and skill reservoir (That's why my grades look nice :slightly_smiling_face:).

Here is the trajectory of my journey after I entered university:

<div markdown="1">
At SUSTech, we don’t select a major in the first year. To figure out which major can equip me with the most relevant skills and knowledge to achieve my dream, I consulted with several professors, primarily from the Biology and Biomedical Engineering departments. After learning about the focus of these majors, I chose BME, which, in my opinion then, addresses senescence **from an engineering perspective** to find solutions, while biology focuses on uncovering the mechanisms.

During these consultations, I got a rough idea that biology involves many compensatory mechanisms. This buried a seed for me to turn to systems biology later. 

*<small>BTW, the professor introduce this just want me not to be so idealized in research. Throughout my journey, I kept consulting professors for advice, and the most common feedback I received was, “Don’t be so idealistic,” “It’s impossible,” and “Why do you want this?” :persevere:</small>*

Only a few professors were encouraging when I shared my dream of immortality, and my mentor [Zhi Luo](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=luoz&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2&lang=en){:target="_blank"} was one of them. He guided me to start with polymer synthesis for diseases related to senescence, like calcification. To contribute to anti-aging research as soon as possible, I joined his lab to learn **polymer synthesis, characterization, and cell culturing**. Everything in the lab was new to me, so I reviewed every detail I learned and self-taught the principles behind the techniques. I also frequently audited group meetings to learn about the research of senior members, absorbed the research principles taught by the professor, and got a general idea of how a lab runs.

However, during the first summer, the senior apprentice was too busy to mentor me on many laboratory skills. So, I used my spare time to dive into the book ***Ageless***, which shifted my thinking.

I followed the [references](https://andrewsteele.co.uk/ageless/references/){:target="_blank"} in the book to explore more details about aging and, most importantly, discovered that we’ve already been able to build a [Whole-Cell Computational Model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412007763?via%3Dihub){:target="_blank"}!

<font color=grey><small><i>I took detailed notes during reading.</i></small></font>
</center>

At the same time, I was worried about the inefficiency, long duration, and high cost of wet lab experiments (since I want to achieve immortality before I die :worried:). I keep on thinking and exploring a more effective way toward my dream.

At the end of my first sophomore semester, reflecting on the ideas in *Ageless*, I generated a vague idea to build a model for us humans, which enables us to know how a human responds to an input drug or treatment. This model should take in those complementary mechanisms into account and think of the whole human holistically. (Later when I read more literatures, I am so excited to know that many researchers are just devoted into it!)

I tried to explain my immature thought to my mentor and he recommended me to learn about **AIDD** (AI Drug Design), which is a project he is also working on.

I then spent my winter holiday teaching myself machine learning, basic probability and statistics, and AIDD. I also enjoyed [Machine Learning and Its Medical Engineering Applications course](/courses#5){:target="_blank"} in the following semester. 

><small>I used a paper-oriented approach to self-learn AIDD, which meant I looked up every new concept in the papers and tried to replicate the code myself. During this process, I learned how to represent molecular structures in SMILES code along with mostly used computational packages and algorithm principles behind them, including, one-hot encoding, max pooling, zero padding, and more.</small>

However, the more I learned about machine learning, the more concerned I became with its data-driven nature. **The “black box” nature of machine learning algorithms just gave me a sense of uncertainty**. Maybe due to my characteristics (always want to seek the fundamental laws behind things), I decided to equip myself with first-principles methods before diving into data-driven simulations.

Since everything, from a single cell to the entire human body, is composed of substances, I thought that if I could understand the laws of substances, I could digitally describe all the substances derived from them.
{: .notice}

It may have seemed naive and idealized, but that’s what I thought when I **applied to transfer to a Chemistry major** at the end of my sophomore year. At the same stage, I contacted professor [Chris Soon Heng Tan](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=christan&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2&lang=en){:target="_blank"}, whose research direction, to my mind that time, combines data-driven and first-principles methods. I got the opportunity to closely learn proteomic wet-lab experiment techniques and dry lab analysis in his group. 

I really appreciate and cherish this opportunity. I spent all my available time of 2024 summer holiday staying in the lab, consulting every senior member of their research projects, learning **proteomic technique details** (including SILAC, Western Blot, SISPROT, CETSA, TPCA, etc.), and reading literatures. This intensive learning equipped me with many critical research skills.

That summer, I get to know the concept of **"emergent phenomenon" and "complex system"** for the first time in PEBBLE biocamp of Westlake University, and again, brought my mind to another level.

<div markdown='1'>
Due to increasing personal mental barrier to chemical experiments, I felt extremely uncomfortable and anxious after the compulsory lab courses, and thus, was forced to withdraw the application for major transfer along with the leaving from professor Chris's lab.

At the same time, inspired by the PEBBLE BioFusion Camp, I took *Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics* out of pure interest (And got A+ at the end, which again proves that I have the ability to do well in what I want to do :blush:). 

Reflecting once more on the path to my dream, I started my third research experience in [Ju Liu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=liuj36&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2){:target="_blank"}'s lab, where I studied vascular models under mechanical principles using computational tools. Although this kind of simulation focuses on mesoscopic scale and mechanical aspects, my goal is to experience the integration of theory and computation, and to master useful computational skills and modeling principles.

*<font color=grey><small>The cylinder and aorta mesh I built up using Gmsh, and the FSI (Fluid-Structure Interaction) simulation result of the cylinder. </small></font>*

I became proficient in **the pipeline for conducting FSI simulations**, and grew more familiar with **Linux, high-performance clusters**, and parallel computing.  In addition to technical skills, I self-studied basic biomechanics and principles of the Finite Element Method (FEM).

I also joined the SUSTech-Med iGEM team and took responsibility for modeling the specific adhesion of engineered E. coli in the tumor microenvironment, demonstrating the specificity of our designed method against rectal cancer. Through this experience, I learned the principles and use of the cell modeling tool **CompuCell3D**, bringing me closer to cell modeling from an individual-based and mechanistic perspective.

Gradually, I came to realize that in most cases, it is neither necessary nor possible to build 100% correct models. **In my view, modeling is about applying known laws to reduce the information entropy of collected data—thereby extracting the meaningful insights we seek.**

Based on the above exploration and greatly inspired by [the Perspective article on AI virtual cell](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.11.015){:target="_blank"}, I have now figured out a relatively clear path toward my dream.
<!-- After the above exploration, I have gradually figure out the path towards my dream.

Having made this clear, I strive to approach it through self-learning and real research, and I have found that this path is not only the **appropriate path** toward my final goal but also where **my passion lies**! I often experience wow moments and flow state when conducting these researches~

<h3 id="8">Research about emergent laws of biology</h3>
I spent the summer of 2025 at Westlake University, [Center for Interdisciplinary Studies (CIS)](https://cis.westlake.edu.cn), in [Yifan Yang](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/Yifan-Yang.shtml){:target="_blank"}'s systems aging lab, where I participated in a project **applying mean-field theory to mechanistically explain the [saturated-removal (SR) model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13192-4.pdf){:target="_blank"}** [^1]. A reasonable mechanistic model can clarify the general meaning and relationships of all the parameters in the SR model, allowing us to further specify what the damage variable *X* represents for a given "node" in the system.  

[^1]: I highly recommend Uri Alon's *Systems Medicine*, which provides a deductive and excellent explanation of the SR model (though the model was obtained by an inductive method in real research)! The potential function of the damage variable *X* aligns perfectly with our intuition!

In the project, I continuously deepened my understanding of the SR model and mean-field–based models. To bridge the two, I studied the Buckingham Pi theorem. I also self-learned more general concepts, such as stochastic differential equations (SDEs), the Poisson process (used for stop condition), basic mean-field theory, and basic extreme value theory, for this project :smile:!

*<font color=grey><small>I conducted numerical simulations within specific parameter space and investigated statistical characteristics and variable distributions to gain insights into how to connect the two models. </small></font>*

CIS and Yang's lab provided me with many opportunities to learn a lot about qbio and complex systems. I made the most of them by attending seminars and also giving presentations in group meetings and journal clubs~

<h3 id="7">Research about bioinformatics</h3>
Under [Peng He](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/peng.he){:target="_blank"}'s guidance, I am adapting and optimizing the dynamic tree cut algorithm to develop bioinformatics tools to enhance analysis. 

- **sc-bulk heatmap**  
  Because single-cell RNA-seq is expensive, many medical researchers still rely on bulk RNA-seq. Peng and I developed the "sc-bulk heatmap" tool, which can automatically provide gene modules, perform functional and motif analysis, and map bulk data to single-cell–level data or markers. This helps researchers extract insights from bulk data with a single click. For example, they can explore the regulation of specific gene networks, identify abnormal phenomena to guide new experimental designs, or even detect potential experimental contamination.  

- **Deeptree**  
  More representative genes improve single-cell annotation and reduce manual work in subsequent subclustering. The Deeptree algorithm Peng and I developed aims to extract "deep genes," which show strong similarity and form significant patterns, thereby reducing the noise in highly variable genes.

I also utilize my bioinformatics skills to (1) analyze microwell-based RNA-seq data to screen polymer drugs in a holistic and systematic way, rather than focusing only on isolated gene expression or pathway variation (with [Zhi Luo](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=luoz&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2&lang=en)); and (2) analyze Drosophila embryo multi-omic data (including bulk RNA-seq analysis with the sc-bulk heatmap pipeline, ChIP-seq analysis, and single-cell annotation) to extract deeper biological insights into mesoderm (esp. cardiac) gene regulation before gastrulation (with [Theodora Koromila](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5504-1369)).
