Welcome! I’m happy to share more about myself and my journey with you :hugs:~

I’m Sijie Li [^1] , from Guangzhou, China, currently an undergraduate major in Biomedical Engineering at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). Right now, I am actively exploring and learning in pursuit of my ultimate dream: longevity :running_woman:... I aspire to dedicate my career to scientific research to get close to my dream.

[^1]: Sijie (given name) Li (family name). 

Here is my print-friendly version [Resume](/files/Resume_SijieLi.pdf){: .btn}{:target="_blank"}.
## Research Goal & Interests
My ultimate research goal is to precisely and quantitatively **simulate the entire human body**. The [Research](/research/){:target="_blank"} page explains the deduction from longevity to this envision and the exploration.   

During the journey to find a more effective way to deal with scenescence, I have engaged in extensive interdisciplinary exploration, which gave me a broad range of interests—perhaps even too broad at times. Through the journey, I have identified my research goal and gradually refined my focus into reletively specific research directions:  

By integrating **physics, AI, and systems biology**, develop first-principles-based computational models to figure out and quantitatively describe **emergent properties** in complex cellular systems, then **scale** these models levels by levels, and finally simulate human biological systems.

## Projects & Research-related Experience
- Project 1: (Machine Learning course) [Segment Brain Regions with fMRI Data](/courses#5){:target="_blank"}
- Project 2: (Signals and Systems course) [Motion Detection via Communication Signals](/courses#6){:target="_blank"}
- Lab Experience 1: (mentorship of Zhi Luo) [Cell Culture and Polymer Synthesis](/research#5){:target="_blank"}
- Lab Experience 2: (mentorship of Chris Soon Heng Tan)[Proteomics](/research#3){:target="_blank"}   
- Lab Experience 3: (mentorship of Professor Ju Liu)[FSI modeling of vascular](/research#6){:target="_blank"}  

## Capability
### Academic ability
My exploration also strengthened my ability to learn and think interdisciplinary. GPA of 3.94/4.00, ranking 1st/70 in my major validate my ability to learn well. Beyond coursework, I am highly self-driven, identifying knowledge gaps and independently seeking online and offline resources to learn new concepts, which reflects my passion and proactivity.
### Comprehensive ability
I actively engage in [academic](/activities#3){:target="_blank"} and [student](/activities#4){:target="_blank"} activities, where I develop my well-rounded abilities not just in academic pursuits but also in communication, leadership, management, and teamwork.

In [life](/life/){:target="_blank"}, I believe in maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle—one that is energetic, positive, curious, perfectionism (sometimes may go too much and need to overcome) and maybe a little quirky:smile:. I enjoy running, creative arts, and exploring new ideas.

Let’s Connect! I would be honored to contribute and cherish every opportunity to learn and grow!
