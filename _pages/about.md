Welcome! I’m happy to share more about myself and my journey with you :hugs:~

I’m Sijie Li [^1] , from Guangzhou, China, currently an undergraduate majoring in Biomedical Engineering at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). Right now, I am actively exploring and learning in pursuit of my ultimate dream: longevity :running_woman:... I aspire to dedicate my career to scientific research to get close to my dream.

[^1]: Sijie (given name) Li (family name). 

Here is my print-friendly version [Resume](/files/Resume_SijieLi.pdf){: .btn}{:target="_blank"}.
## Research Goal & Interests
My ultimate research goal is to precisely and quantitatively **simulate the entire human body**. The [Research](/research/){:target="_blank"} page explains reasoning behind my journey from longevity to this vision, as well as the ongoing exploration.

During the journey to find a more effective way to address senescence, I have engaged in extensive interdisciplinary exploration, which has given me a broad range of interests—perhaps even too broad at times. Through the journey, I have identified my research goal and gradually refined my focus into relatively specific research directions:  

By integrating **physics, AI, and systems biology**, develop first-principles-based computational models to understand and quantitatively describe **emergent properties** in complex cellular systems, then **scale** these models levels by levels, and finally simulate human biological systems.

## Projects & Research-related Experience
- Project 1: (Machine Learning course) [Segment Brain Regions with fMRI Data](/courses#5){:target="_blank"}
- Project 2: (Signals and Systems course) [Motion Detection via Communication Signals](/courses#6){:target="_blank"}
- Lab Experience 1: (Mentorship of Zhi Luo) [Cell Culturing and Polymer Synthesis](/research#5){:target="_blank"}
- Lab Experience 2: (Mentorship of Chris Soon Heng Tan) [Proteomics](/research#3){:target="_blank"}   
- Lab Experience 3: (Mentorship of Professor Ju Liu) [FSI Modeling of the Vasculature](/research#6){:target="_blank"}  

## Capability
### Academic ability
My exploration also strengthened my ability to learn and think interdisciplinarily. GPA of 3.94/4.00 and ranking **1/70** in my major validate my ability to learn well. Beyond coursework, I am highly self-driven, identifying knowledge gaps and independently seeking both online and offline resources to learn new concepts, which reflects my passion and proactive attitude.
### Comprehensive ability
I actively engage in [academic](/activities#3){:target="_blank"} and [student](/activities#4){:target="_blank"} activities, where I develop my well-rounded abilities not just in academic pursuits but also in communication, leadership, management, and teamwork.

In [life](/life/){:target="_blank"}, I believe in maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle—one that is energetic, positive, curious, perfectionistic (sometimes may go too much and need to overcome) and maybe a little quirky:smile:. I enjoy running, creative arts, and exploring new ideas.
