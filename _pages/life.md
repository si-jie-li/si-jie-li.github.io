For relaxation, I enjoy filling the leisure time with [**arts**](#3) (mainly painting), [**sports**](#2) (mainly running and Pilates), and [**reading**](#1) (esp. about health and science).
<h2 id="3">Arts</h2>
I learned drawing, caligraphy, and piano at an early age and they are still important ways to relax myself now, especially drawing for its convenience. I can practice my concentration through these highly focusing activities (required to be still for hours). Most imporantly, I can really feel that the aesthetic capability and creativity I obtained benefit my scientific study and showcases.

Drawing is what I am most good at. I have contined hone my skill since 5 years old and won several national and worldwide prizes. I work with a variety of mediums (including: sketching, watercolor, colored pencils, acrylic painting, etc.) and my portfolio spans diverse styles and approaches (including: master studies, observational drawing, original creative works, and mixed-media handcrafted pieces).

<h2 id="2">Sports</h2>
I have the habit of running from junior high school year. Later, Pilates adds to my sports list during the pandemic. These two convenient sports are irreplacable in my routine. Of course, I will sometimes take on other sport forms, including hiking, climbing mountain, badminton, etc.

<h2 id="1">Reading</h2>
It is generalized "reading". Sure, I read literature work, biography particularly. But I enjoy more in informative books and **different types of articles about health and science**, which are part of my daily life.

To achieve my dream -- longevity, of course, I should maintain a healthy life in a scientific way. There are many contradictory suggestions on health, so, to execute the more correct action(there may be no absolutely correct, at least in my opinion), I equip myself with the principles of those suggestions through reading. (I even have audited the course *diet and health* for a whole semester.) The sources may be official WeChat articles, handbooks and national official guidances, book about traditional Chinese medicine, scientific papers, etc.

I also love knowing the frontiers or issues of science. The articles from Nature Briefing, Nature Career are the main sources. BTW, listening to podcast (e.g. Nature, ScienceVS, Zoe, etc.) can also provides me with the health and science information I want.
