You’re here to learn about my colorful life~ or maybe, to encounter a **totally different me** :sunglasses: compared to the other pages (where I might seem quite serious).

For relaxation, I enjoy filling the leisure time with [**arts**](#3) (mainly painting), [**sports**](#2) (mainly running and Pilates), and [**reading**](#1) (esp. about health and science).
<h2 id="3">Arts</h2>
I learned drawing, calligraphy, and piano at an early age, and they’re still important ways for me to relax now, especially drawing, because of its convenience. These **highly focused activities** (which require me to stay still for hours) help me improve my concentration. Most importantly, I can really feel that the aesthetic sensitivity and creativity I’ve developed **benefit both my scientific studies and visual presentations**.

Drawing is what I'm best at. I’ve been honing my skills since the age of five and have won several national and international awards. I work with **a variety of mediums** (including sketching, watercolor, colored pencils, acrylic painting...) and my portfolio spans **diverse styles and approaches** (including master studies, observational drawing, original creative works, and mixed-media handcrafted pieces).

<h2 id="2">Sports</h2>
school year.
I‘ve had the habit of **running** since junior high school. Later, **Pilates** came into my sports list during the pandemic. These two convenient forms of exercise have become irreplaceable parts of my routine. Of course, I also occasionally take part in other exercises, including **hiking, mountain climbing, badminton**, and more.

<h2 id="1">Reading</h2>
By "reading", I mean it in a broad sense. Sure, I read literature -- especially biographies. But I enjoy **informative books and various types of articles on health and science** even more -- they're part of my daily life.

To achieve my dream -- longevity -- I of course, I should maintain a healthy life in a scientific way. There are **many conflicting suggestions about health**. So, to take the most informed actions (since I believe there may be no absolutely correct ones), I try to **understand the principles behind them** through reading. (I even have audited the course *diet and health* for a whole semester.) My sources include official WeChat articles, health handbooks, national guidelines, books on traditional Chinese medicine, scientific papers, and more.

I also enjoy **learning about the frontiers and key issues in science**. The articles from *Nature Briefing*, *Nature Careers* are the main sources. BTW, listening to **podcasts** (e.g. *Nature*, *ScienceVS*, *Zoe*, etc.) can also provides me with the health and science information I want.
