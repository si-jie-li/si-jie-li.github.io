I actively participate in [academic activities](#3) and [sutdent activities](#4).
<h1 id="3">Academic Activities</h1>
I pay close attention to the information related to my interest areas through multiple platforms and often attend to the sharings, workshops, reports, seminars, meetings, and forums held by students, professors, schools, or institutions both online and on site. At first, unable to fully understand every details makes me struggle. After times of participation, communication with professors, and accumulation of interdisciplinary knowledge, I gradually get the hang of the how to make the most of these academic activities!

Some of academic activities I have participated:
- **Chemical Biology Summer Training Course** (Peking University, 2024 summer)
  - Chemical biology as research tools and their applications, including proteomics, labeling, bioorthogonal Reaction, synthesis, etc.
- **[PEBBLE BioFusion Camp](#1)** (Westlake University, 2024 summer)
- **[Undergraduate Life Sciences Conference](#2)** (SUSTech, 2024 fall)

Hope I can participate as a presenter sharing interesting idea and knowledge in more academic activities in the future :fist:~

<h2 id="1">PEBBLE BioFusion Camp</h2>
I went to the camp just when I was at the orientation exploring stage, unsatisfying about the uninterpretable results from those complex machine learning algorithm, and wanting to equipe myself with enough theoretical knowledge to explain these results from the first-principle. And it really has changed my view towards the world!

During the camp, I got to know the way to quatitatively describe biological processes from the perspective of statistical physics (esp. complex systems, emergent phenomenon), AI, etc. Though most of the time, I was stuck with the deep theories because I did not have enough preknowledge and corresponding subject background, I went to some LLM and learning resources for help and absorb the high level ideas and the power of these studies. Heavily inspired by these ideas, I make my objectives more clear, start learning relavent knowledge, and focus more on these areas. <font color=grey><small><i>Due to heavy coursework, so far I have just finished the thermodynamics part. I wish I could have time to carry out systematically learning and I believe I can do a good job in these learnings!</i></small></font>

We have accomplished a group project. The reason why I chose to do the project about active matter is that I want to try some completely unfamiliar research. Indeed, I learned relevant knowledge at the beginning like a headless fly. However, through reading articles, videos, and inquiring Chatgpt, I understood the detailed process of model establishment and even making constructive solution on model deduction during the discussion with the graduate students. 

<h2 id="2">Undergraduate Life Sciences Conference</h2>

On the conference, we undergraduate students shared our knowledge and understanding in Biotechnology. I share the power of cardiovascular modeling, in my opinion, a technology to getting hidden biological information by integrating physics theories. During the intensive preparation, I futher deepen my understanding towards modeling and finite element method.

<h1 id="5">Student Activities</h1>

I have joined [Student Branch of SUSTech Red Cross](#5) and New Media Studio of Shuren college, which provided opportunities to contribute myself and cultivates my comoprehensive ability, in cluding presentation skill, leadership, and publicity related skill. 
My reliability and dedication towards every task has won me high praises and recognitions (e.g Outstanding Student Leader Award). <font color=grey><small><i>(Admittedly, the purchase of perfectionism in these works sometimes may over-consume myself and cause anxiety.)</i></small></font>
<h2 id="6">Student Branch of SUSTech Red Cross</h2>
Aligning with my dream of longevity, I joined Red Cross to equip myself with first-aid knowledge in case of emergency and those health related knowledge. For specific department, I chose publicity. For one thing, I want to maximize my art skills cultivated before, continue art creation, and learn the tools to express myself in an electronic form which is easier to promote nowadays than my familiar paper form. For another, I want to spread those useful knowledge to more people so that more lives can be saved.

After intensive learning the theoretical knowledge and regular practice hand-on first-aid skills, I obtain **Certificat for Red Cross First Aider** from Shenzhen Red Cross and **Heartsaver First Aid CPR AED** from American Heart Association (AHA). Then I stepped on the journey to make what I learned prevalent and take part in many security assurance tasks.

- ### Create Publicity Content
I achieve my creation intention and spread knowledge at the same time. I have created a lot of high quality posters, WeChat articles (40+ published on official account), and souvenirs.  

    Aside from those [regular and informative publicity articles about first-aid](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/E-QEsRW0SQfnHRgC0oZRqA){:target="_blank"}, I also tried to included more daily content in interesting ways. I introduce strip cartoon (the second one below) form to our official account for the first time and was thought highly of and obtain high read count! Click and hope you can enjoy while harvesting~

- ### Give Lessons in the School and Communities
I have given **10 lessons** both in SUSTech and coummunities of Shenzhen. The contents I taught are mainly theoretical, so to make them easier for public to memorize, I dived into the mechanism of those first-aid actions and tried to demonstrate them in an attractive and engaging way.  

    I have taught [snake bite](/files/activity/student/Sijie_SnakeBite.pdf){: .btn}{:target="_blank"}, [sport injury](/files/activity/student/Sijie_SportInjury.pdf){: .btn}{:target="_blank"}, [common medicine](/files/activity/student/Sijie_CommonMedicine.pdf){: .btn}{:target="_blank"}, [introduction to first aid](/files/activity/student/Sijie_IntroFirstAid.pdf){: .btn}{:target="_blank"}, and airway obstruction. Click to have a look and fill your "first-aid toolbox"! <font color=grey><small><i>All the slides I used are made by myself, crystallized my understanding, though they are just "assistant" and my presentation itself is the essence :grin:.</i></small></font>

- ### Organize the Publicity Work as Publicity Minister
I was recommended to hold post of publicity minister in the organization at the end of my first year. During this year as minister, I templatize those repeating tasks to save time for creative works, coordinate all the publicity work of our organization, and create a whole new form of article for our official account -- the [interesting Q&A series](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/appmsgalbum?__biz=Mzg3ODgxOTIwNQ==&action=getalbum&album_id=3210771996113125385&subscene=126&scenenote=https%3A%2F%2Fmp.weixin.qq.com%2Fs%3F__biz%3DMzg3ODgxOTIwNQ%3D%3D%26mid%3D2247488515%26idx%3D1%26sn%3Da797d4d57f1a928ff0eb756c82b4ca18%26chksm%3Dce68a17d9a58e5a3ec6267ad8f977668e3fef7cccb7e35dee8f3add598bc199d7984e049cef7%26scene%3D126%26sessionid%3D0%26subscene%3D0%26clicktime%3D1743345508%26enterid%3D1743345508%26ascene%3D3%26devicetype%3DiOS18.3.2%26version%3D1800392b%26nettype%3D3G%2B%26abtest_cookie%3DAAACAA%253D%253D%26lang%3Den%26fontScale%3D100%26exportkey%3Dn_ChQIAhIQ2KEHwssg71wdmkSZAbqy3BLeAQIE97dBBAEAAAAAAE6PBJjC2QgAAAAOpnltbLcz9gKNyK89dVj0GO7kOsIVXNNh8PDwtEbzL08ywCLm2D2hjnWqmzM6y0WCxxq1F4Q4yqDZ2NilCCJG1Ownet3BNk8aF0UF2e59k6WKk%252BdQlesYnhvkE5EUzJieLymjRRBf06cqh8twhm9keZmqjuxB7ug8y8Z2T%252FLNqYrPkYOYNW6%252BmJXV2TOz6ZF3nlKw4r9wlJJmZfQsWH%252BvKj1GDIRlf3%252FRnu2RyDzFKnN630galO32CxCJmGW5xYVHNyMWFzNmeg%253D%253D%26pass_ticket%3DGrR8UnBBiy4ZOiBF3hS%252FlSmxwrQtQHbuvkWRQccP4gkpYEF1eYnGptXtHCZAW8SK%26wx_header%3D3&nolastread=1#wechat_redirect){:target="_blank"} and the [Xiaojiu (mascot) tells you series](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/32ZUmdMRf69CahgZaBeimg){:target="_blank"}.

    I have been responsible for the task distribution, revision and checking of 60+ articles. At times, I was at the edge of collapsing due to my perfectionism. In May 2024, we continuously published WeChat articles for a whole month, which is really a devastating :persevere: period for me along with my two large course projects. However, to my delight, our works have earned a high reputation and reached to more and more people in this intensive period.
