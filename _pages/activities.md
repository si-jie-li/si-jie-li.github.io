I actively participate in both [academic activities](#3) and [student activities](#5).
<h1 id="3">Academic Activities</h1>
I **keep a close eye on information related to my areas of interest** through multiple platforms and often attend talks, workshops, presentations, seminars, meetings, and forums organized by students, professors, universities, or research institutions, both online and in person. At first, I struggled to understand all the details. However, through repeated participation, communication with professors, and the accumulation of interdisciplinary knowledge, I gradually learned how to make the most of these academic activities!

Some of the academic activities I have participated in include:
- **Chemical Biology Summer Training Course** (Peking University, Summer 2024)
  - Explored chemical biology as a research tool and its applications, including proteomics, labeling, bioorthogonal reactions, synthesis, and more.
- **[PEBBLE BioFusion Camp](#1)** (Westlake University, Summer 2024)
- **[Undergraduate Life Sciences Conference](#2)** (SUSTech, Fall 2024)

I hope to participate as a presenter in more academic events in the future, sharing interesting ideas and knowledge with others :fist:~

<h2 id="1">PEBBLE BioFusion Camp</h2>
I attended the camp when I was still in the stage of exploring my orientation -- feeling **unsatisfied with the uninterpretable results** of complex machine learning algorithms and **eager to equip myself with enough theoretical knowledge to explain those results from first principles**. And it really has changed the way I see the world!

>**Harvest**   
During the camp, I got to know the way to **quantitatively describe biological processes from the perspective of statistical physics** (esp. complex systems, emergent phenomena), **AI**, and more. Although I was often stuck on the deeper theories due to my lack of prior knowledge and background in related subjects, I turned to LLM and other learning resources to help me **absorb the high-level ideas and appreciate the power behind these studies**.  
Heavily inspired by these concepts, I clarified my objectives, began **learning the relevant knowledge**, and started focusing more on these areas. <font color=grey><small><i>Due to a heavy coursework load, I have so far only completed the thermodynamics part. I hope to have time to continue learning systematically, and I believe I can do well in these studies!</i></small></font>

We completed a group project, and I chose the project about **active matter** because **I wanted to try something completely unfamiliar**. At the beginning, I felt like a **headless fly** as I tried to learn the relevant concepts. However, through reading articles, watching videos, and inquiring Chatgpt, I gradually **understood** the modeling process in detail and even contributed constructively on model deduction during discussions with graduate students.

<h2 id="2">Undergraduate Life Sciences Conference</h2>

At the conference, we undergraduate students shared our knowledge and understanding of biotechnology. I presented on the power of cardiovascular **modeling**, which I believe **is a technology that reveals hidden biological information by integrating physical theories**. Through the intensive preparation process, I further deepened my understanding of modeling and the finite element method.

<h1 id="4">Student Activities</h1>

I have joined the [Student Branch of SUSTech Red Cross](#6) and the New Media Studio of Shuren College, both of which have provided me with opportunities to contribute and develop my comprehensive abilities, including presentation skills, leadership, and publicity-related competencies. **My reliability and dedication** to every task have earned me high praise and recognition, such as the Outstanding Student Leader Award. 
<font color=grey><small><i>(Admittedly, my pursuit of perfection in these roles has sometimes led to overexertion and anxiety.)</i></small></font>
<h2 id="6">Student Branch of SUSTech Red Cross</h2>
In alignment with my dream of **longevity**, I joined the Red Cross to equip myself with **first-aid and health-related knowledge** in case of emergencies. I chose to work in the **publicity department**. On one hand, I want to make full use of the artistic skills I had developed earlier, continue creating art, and learn tools to **express myself in digital forms**, which are more widely promoted today than my familiar paper media. On the other hand, I aim to **spread these valuable knowledge to more people** so that more lives can be saved.

After intensively studying theoretical knowledge and regularly practicing hands-on first-aid skills, I obtained the ***Certificat for Red Cross First Aider*** from Shenzhen Red Cross and the ***Heartsaver First Aid CPR AED*** certificate from American Heart Association (AHA). I then embarked on a journey to popularize what I had learned and participated in many safety assurance tasks.

- ### Create Publicity Content
I have achieved my intention to create while spreading knowledge at the same time. I have produced many **high-quality** posters, **WeChat articles (40+ published on official account)**, and souvenirs.

    Aside from [regular and informative articles about first aid](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/E-QEsRW0SQfnHRgC0oZRqA){:target="_blank"}, I also tried to incorporate more everyday content in interesting ways. I **introduced the strip cartoon format** (see the second one below) to our official account for the first time, which was highly praised and received a high number of reads! Click to view and hope you can enjoy while harvesting~

- ### Give Lessons in the School and Communities
I have given **10 lessons** both at SUSTech and in communities across Shenzhen. The content I taught was mainly theoretical, so to make it easier for the public to remember, I explored the mechanisms behind first-aid actions and aimed to present them in an engaging and memorable way.

    I have taught [snake bite](/files/activity/student/Sijie_SnakeBite.pdf){: .btn}{:target="_blank"}, [sport injury](/files/activity/student/Sijie_SportInjury.pdf){: .btn}{:target="_blank"}, [common medicine](/files/activity/student/Sijie_CommonMedicine.pdf){: .btn}{:target="_blank"}, [introduction to first aid](/files/activity/student/Sijie_IntroFirstAid.pdf){: .btn}{:target="_blank"}, and airway obstruction. Click to have a look and fill your "first-aid toolbox"! <font color=grey><small><i>All the slides I used are made by myself, crystallized my understanding, though they are just "assistant" and my presentation itself is the essence :grin:.</i></small></font>

- ### Organize the Publicity Work as a Publicity Minister
I was recommended for the position of publicity minister at the end of my first year. During my term, I **standardized repetitive** tasks to save time for creative work, **coordinated all publicity efforts** for our organization, and **introduced new article formats** for our official account—such as the [engaging Q&A series](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/appmsgalbum?__biz=Mzg3ODgxOTIwNQ==&action=getalbum&album_id=3210771996113125385&subscene=126&scenenote=https%3A%2F%2Fmp.weixin.qq.com%2Fs%3F__biz%3DMzg3ODgxOTIwNQ%3D%3D%26mid%3D2247488515%26idx%3D1%26sn%3Da797d4d57f1a928ff0eb756c82b4ca18%26chksm%3Dce68a17d9a58e5a3ec6267ad8f977668e3fef7cccb7e35dee8f3add598bc199d7984e049cef7%26scene%3D126%26sessionid%3D0%26subscene%3D0%26clicktime%3D1743345508%26enterid%3D1743345508%26ascene%3D3%26devicetype%3DiOS18.3.2%26version%3D1800392b%26nettype%3D3G%2B%26abtest_cookie%3DAAACAA%253D%253D%26lang%3Den%26fontScale%3D100%26exportkey%3Dn_ChQIAhIQ2KEHwssg71wdmkSZAbqy3BLeAQIE97dBBAEAAAAAAE6PBJjC2QgAAAAOpnltbLcz9gKNyK89dVj0GO7kOsIVXNNh8PDwtEbzL08ywCLm2D2hjnWqmzM6y0WCxxq1F4Q4yqDZ2NilCCJG1Ownet3BNk8aF0UF2e59k6WKk%252BdQlesYnhvkE5EUzJieLymjRRBf06cqh8twhm9keZmqjuxB7ug8y8Z2T%252FLNqYrPkYOYNW6%252BmJXV2TOz6ZF3nlKw4r9wlJJmZfQsWH%252BvKj1GDIRlf3%252FRnu2RyDzFKnN630galO32CxCJmGW5xYVHNyMWFzNmeg%253D%253D%26pass_ticket%3DGrR8UnBBiy4ZOiBF3hS%252FlSmxwrQtQHbuvkWRQccP4gkpYEF1eYnGptXtHCZAW8SK%26wx_header%3D3&nolastread=1#wechat_redirect){:target="_blank"} and the [“Xiaojiu (mascot) tells you” series](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/32ZUmdMRf69CahgZaBeimg){:target="_blank"}.

    I have been responsible for the task distribution, revision, and checking of 60+ articles. At times, I was on the verge of collapse due to my perfectionism. In May 2024, we published WeChat articles continuously for an entire month, which was a truly devastating period for me -- especially with two major course projects going on :persevere:. However, to my delight, our work earned a great reputation and reached more and more people during that intensive time.
