title: "How I Enjoy My Learning Journey in Coursework..."
---
I equip myself with a note-taking system and learning strategies. Generally, I enjoy my courses through engagement, discussion, presentations, homework, and projects, all of which help build my comprehensive abilities. I also **self-learn** some expansive or interested courses through textbooks or online sources. Particularly, I devote a large amount of time and energy to most **course projects, treating them as my own research projects** because they provide intensive training.

One of the characteristics of my coursework is its **interdisciplinary** nature, which provides me with knowledge, ideas, and skills in various fields. In my opinion, this interdisciplinary thinking is important in the **AI era**, where more emphasis is placed on our **ability to question from different perspectives and integrate information to get meaningful insights**. My great performance in these interdisciplinary coursework also demonstrates my corresponding ability. [Transcript](/files/course_mat/Transcript_SijieLi.pdf){: .btn}{:target="_blank"}

The following are some of the couserwork (mainly after sophormore year) I have taken, along with my takeaways.

<h2 id="1">Basic Synthetic Biology</h2>
Motivation: Knowing that synthetic biology is an important tool to study emergent phenomena.

Recently, Recently, I gave a presentation on the future after the creation of the first synthetic cell, which was a whole new topic for me. The limited preparation time and the good performance prove my ability to read literature and quickly get the hang of an unfamiliar field.

<h2 id="2">Programmable Biomolecular Design</h2>
I participated as an **auditing** student. So far, I have learned the **design principles** of DNA, RNA, and proteins, along with the use of various design and visualization **tools**, including Rosetta, Tiamat, caDNAno, PyMol, etc.

<h2 id="3">Biomechanics</h2>
The essence of this course is learning how to **abstract and simplify objectives to a reasonable degree**, enabling the quantitative description of biological behaviors. 

In the course project, I was responsible for establishing a tube model to theoretically explore the effects of ventricular septal defects, aiming to facilitate clinical judgment on whether to carry out surgery.

Our group also wrote an [essay](/files/course_mat/BM_final_report.pdf){:target="_blank"} about our work.
<h2 id="4">Intelligent Sensing Technology</h2>
This course, taught by my mentor, inspired me a lot! The principles and engineering thinking behind sensors always amaze me. I really enjoyed the **quantitative thinking** and the **clever tricks used to bridge theories to applications** tpresented in this course.

In our presentation, we gave an overview on the early identification of Alzheimer's disease and we had to go through extensive searching and reading to build a broad understanding of the existing methods. I was responsible for all parts except the OCT detection.

During the preparation, I gained a deeper understanding — the essence of a sensor is to **convert characteristics into detectable signals utilizing existing knowledge** (physical theories, material properties, etc.).

<h2 id="5">Machine Learning and Its Medical Engineering Applications</h2>
For the theoretical part, this course introduced the mathematical descriptions of many fundamental machine learning algorithms, including regression (linear, Ridge, LASSO), logistic regression, SVM (kernel, soft and hard margin), PCA (principle and realization via SVD), LDA, clustering, and neural networks (RNN, LSTM, CNN), etc. I enjoyed **re-deriving** each of them after class to ensure I had fully understood them, and I **gained many important intuitions through this process**. (Sometimes, extra learning materials were needed.)

For the project, we were given a set of fMRI data (covering the 360 brain sites over 364 time points, collected from individuals performing different tasks and from different countries) and were required to generate brain atlases and conduct further analyses if possible. In the team, I served as the **team leader**, contributing most of the ideas and handling key responsibilities, including **drawing pipline to offer our guide our direction, revising our demonstration, presenting our work**, etc.

>**Idea Generation**  
Dividing **base on what features** and **how to evaluate** the result are the two main points I focused on. **Inspired by what I learned in Signals and Systems, I initially attempted to analyze the data in the frequency domain**. However, the sparsity of time points led to significant information loss after Fourier transformation. I then shifted to extracting data complexity as a feature. After **studying the concept of complexity systematically and comparing the preliminary PCA results** under different complexity measures, I ultimately chose Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC). Also **inspired by the sliding window concept from Signals and Systems**, I further explored the effect of window size and obtained an unexpected result！<font color=grey>(smaller window retain more information? NO!)</font>

Our work was innovative because we were the **only group focusing on the features of data** and our strategy greatly **lowers the burden of computation** while achieving **better performance**.

<font color=grey><small><i>Screenshots of my chats with the TA — I received a lot of technical guidance from him :rose:~ Initially, <b>he suggested that we use a conventional pipeline to ensure expected results, but I insisted on trying my own approach unless it failed.</b> In the end, he was amazed by my presentation.</i></small></font>

We also wrote an [essay](/files/course_mat/ml/SijieLi_MLproject_report.pdf){:target="_blank"} on our project. I truly gained a lot from this experience — from **idea generation, repeated trials, organizing task distribution, evaluating results, to presenting and demonstrating our findings** (especially learning how to use PowerPoint and AI tools for academic illustrations).

*BTW, I came up with the idea to compare correlation matrices to validate the effectiveness of LZC (an idea praised by Professor Liu). Later, I was surprised to discover that this is actually a widely used strategy in many research areas (e.g., identifying network motifs by comparing their occurrence frequency with random networks). I’m so proud of myself!*

<h2 id="6">Signals and Systems</h2>
This course covered typical signals (used as bases), common systems and their combinations, their mathematical descriptions, real-world applications, and signal processing using MATLAB. 

Since then, I have viewed the world differently. In my understanding, **almost everything in the world can be abstracted as signals and systems**.
{: .notice}

I was responsible for the course project to decode movement (position and velocity—at a non-quantum scale :grin:) from batches of radar signals. Besides basic tasks, I also explored using `fft()` to **boost processing speed** and **enhancing multi-dimensional resolution**.

<font color=grey><small><i>Click to view the slide. The clear and neat presentation, along with my deep understanding, earned me high praise from the teacher—especially because <b>I was one of the few students who clearly understood why specific precision and range were chosen when plotting the results</b>. To be honest, I was <b>initially stuck</b> on the mechanism of the ambiguity function and many technical coding details. This also gave me a greater sense of achievement after figuring everything out! I also raised a pending question that had been overlooked by the teacher (at the final part of report).</i></small></font>

I also wrote a [report](/files/course_mat/ss/SijieLi_SS_report.pdf){:target="_blank"} on this project including details and code. <small>(Although there were three members in our group, we completed two separate projects, and I was fully responsible for this movement detection one.)</small>

<h2 id="4">Principles of Electric Gircuits</h2>
The theoretical part covered the fundamentals of circuits, including analysis in the complex domain and s-domain, as well as analog and digital circuits.

In the practical part, we followed circuit diagrams to manually solder devices (e.g., lights, signal generators, arteriographs, etc.). Our final project was to assemble a car and control its movement. I was responsible for the coding part, and after much trial and error with my teammates, we finally achieved **control using both the infrared signals from a remote and Bluetooth from our phones**.
