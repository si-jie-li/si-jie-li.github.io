title: "How I enjoy my learning journey in coursework..."
---
I equip myself with a note system and learning strategies. Generally, I enjoy those couses through engagement, discussion, presentation, homework, and project, which all build up my comprehensive ability. I also self-learn some expansive or interested courses through textbook or online sources. Particularly, I devote a large amount of time and energy into most course projects, treating them as my own research projects because I can be intensively trained through them.

One of the characteristics of my coursework is interdisciplinary, which provides me with knowledge, ideas, and skills in many different area. In my opinion, this interdisciplinary thinking is important in AI era where requires more on our ability to question from different perspectives and integrate information. My great performance in these interdisciplinary coursework also proves my corresponding ability. [Transcript](/files/course_mat/Transcript_SijieLi.pdf){: .btn}{:target="_blank"}

The following are some of the couserwork (mainly after sophormore year) I have taken along with harvest.

<h2 id="1">Basic Synthetic Biology</h2>
Motivation: Knowing that synthetic biology is an important tool to study emergent phenomenon.
Recently, I have presented on the future after the first synthetic cell, which is a new for me. Limit preparation time and the good performance prove my ability to read literatures and quickly get the hang of an unfamiliar field.

<h2 id="3">Biomechanics</h2>
Showing how to abstract and simplify objectives in a reasonable degree so that enable the quantitive description of biological behaviors is the essence of this course.  

In the course project, I am responsible to establish a tube model to theoretically explore the effects of sentricular Septal defects, aiming to facilitating clinical judgement on wether to carry out surgery.

Our group also wrote an [essay](/files/course_mat/BM_final_report.pdf){:target="_blank"} to our work.
<h2 id="4">Intelligent Sensing Technology</h2>
This course taught by my mentor just inspired me a lot! The principles and engineering thinking behind sensors always amaze me! I really enjoyed the quantitive thinking and the smart tricks to bridge theories to applications presented in this course.

In the presentation, we give an overview on the early identification of Alzheimer's disease and we had to go through a lot of sesarch and reading to get a broad idea of the existing methods. I am responsible for the part excluding the OCT detection.

<font color=grey><small><i>Click to view the slide of our group. During preparation, I gained a deeper understanding -- The essence of the sensor is to transfer charateristics to detectable signal utilizing existing knowledge (physical theories, material properties, etc.).</i></small></font>

<h2 id="5">Machine Learning and Its Medical Engineering Applications</h2>
For the theoretical part, mathematical descriptions of many fundamental machine learning algorithms are introduced in this course, including regression (linear, Ridge, LASSO), logistic regression, SVM (kernel, soft and hard boundary), PCA (SVD), LDA, clustering, neural network (RNN and LSTM, CNN), etc. I enjoy deriving each of them agian after every class to ensure I have fully understood, and gained a lot of important intuitions through this process. (Sometimes, extra learning materials were needed.)

For the project, we were given a set of fmri data (cover the whole brain and a series of time, collected from people doing different tasks and across different nations) and required to draw brain atlases and carry out further analysis if possible. In the teamwork, I was the team leader who brought out most of the ideas and carried out important work, including drawing pipline to offer our group direction, revising our demonstration, presenting our work, etc.

><small>Dividing base on what features and how to evaluate the result are the two main points I focused on. Inspired by what I learned in Signals and Systems, I firstly tried to analyze data from frequency domain. However, the sparsity of time point causing huge information loss after Fourier transformation. Then I turned to extract the complexity as the feature of data and after learning complexity systematically and comparing the primary PCA result under different complexity, I finally determined to use Lempel-Ziv
Complexity (LZC). Also inspired by the concept of sliding window from Signals and Systems, I further explores the influence on the window size and obtained unexpected result！<font color=grey>(smaller window retain more information? NO!)</font></small>

Our work is innovative because we were the only group focusing on the features of data and our strategy greatly lowers the burden of computation but with higher performance.

<font color=grey><small><i>Screenshots of chats with TA. I got a lot of technical guidance from him :rose:~ At first, he suggested us to use conventional pipline to ensure an expected result, but I insisted on having a try unless it failed. Finally, he was amazed after my presentation.</i></small></font>

We also wrote a [essay](/files/course_mat/ml/SijieLi_MLproject_report.pdf){:target="_blank"} on our project. I really harvested a lot from this project from ideas generating, recurrent trial, organizing work distribution, to result evaluation, demonstration (esp. how to use powerpoint and AI to aid academic drawing), and presentation.

*BTW, I come up with the idea to compare correlation matrices to validate the efficacy of LZC (which was praised by professor Liu) and latter I was surprised to find out that is it an important strategies in many tasks (e.g. determine the network motifs by comparing the frequency it occuring to a random network). I am so proud of myself!*

<h2 id="6">Signals and Systems</h2>
Typical signals (used as basis), typical systems and their combination, mathematical description of them, real applications, and processing signal using MATLAB are taught in this course. 

>I view the world differenty from then on. To my understanding, almost everything in the world can be extracted as signals and systems.

I was responsible for course project to decode the movement (position, velocity -- nonquantum scale:grin:) from bunches of rador signal. Besides basic tasks, I also explored the way to use `fft()` to boost processing speed and to enhance resolution of multi-dimensions.

<font color=grey><small><i>Click to view the slide. The clearly and neat demonstration along with the deep understanding won me the high praise from teacher (esp. for I was the few who clearly understanding why to choose specific precision and range when ploting the result). To be honest, I was first stuck with the mechanism of ambiguity function and lots of technique coding details. This also gives me a great sense of achievement after figuring everything out! I also pose a pending questions ignored by the teacher (at the final part of report).</i></small></font>

I also wrote a [report](/files/course_mat/ss/SijieLi_SS_report.pdf){:target="_blank"} on this project including details and codes. (Though there are three members, we had 2 projects and I was fully reponsible for this movement detection project.)

<h2 id="4">Principles of Electric Gircuits</h2>
Fundamentals of circuits (including the analysis in compolex domain and s-domian), analog circuit, and digital circuit are included in teh theoretical part.

For practicle part, we follow the diagram to manually weld divices (e.g. light, signal generator, arteriograph, etc.). Our final project is to weld a car and control its movement. I am responsible for the coding part and after trial and error with my teammates, we finally realizing controlling through both the infrared of remote control and bluetooth of our phones.
