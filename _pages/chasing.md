title: "Ambitious is not the same as impossible"
---
I dream of achiving longevity even immortal from an early age so that I can have enough time to fulfill my curiosity by exploring the nature of nature. After enter university, I realize that I can achieve this by research besides just living a healthy lifestyle. From then on, I start my chasing toward my dream in an academic way. I have shifted among several different directions after reflections, but all for the same intention -- understand and deal with senescence! All I know from the first point is that senescence is quite a complex thing and dealing with it requires interdisciplinary knowledge and solid foundation, so I keep on going all out in every courses to maximize my knowledge and skill resevoir (That's why my grade looks nice :slightly_smiling_face:).

Here is my chasing trajectory after I enter university: 

- [Select BME](#1)

- [Start from Anti-aging drug](#5)

- [Turn to computational methods](#2)

- [Explore strategies to model](#3)

- [Finding research focus...](#4)

<h2 id="1">Select BME</h2>
In SUSTech, we have not determine our major during the first. To figure out which major can equip me with the most related skills and knowledge to achieve my dream, I have appointed and consulted many professors, mainly within the Biology and Biomedical Engineering deparment. After getting the ideas what these majors focus on, I selected BME to **deal with senescence from an engineering perspective**, which, in my opinion then, focuses on finding solutions while the biology guys focuses on figuring out the mechanisms.

During the consulting, I get a rough idea that there are a lot of compensation mechanisms in biology (the professor introduce this just want me not to be so idealized in research). This buried a seed for me to turn to systems biology later.

<h2 id="5">Start from Anti-aging drug</h2>
Only few professors showing encouraging attitude after hearing my dream of immortal, and my mentor Zhi Luo is one of them. He instructed me to start from synthesis polymer dealing with diseases related to senescence, like calcification. To contribute to the anti-aging research as soon as possible, I enter his lab to learn the skills related to polymer synthesis, characterization, and cell culturing. Everything in the labotary is quite new to me, and to get familiar of them, I both reviewed every details I learned and self-learn the principles behind techniques.

However, during the first summer, senior apprentice was too busy to tutorial me on many of the labotary skill, and I utilized the spare time diving into the book *Ageless*, which led to my thought shifting.

<h2 id="2">Turn to computational methods</h2>
In the last chapter of *Ageless*'s "Treating ageing" part, the author indicates the complexity of aging calls for solving aging problem using computational methods from a holistic perspective, which, for me, is the most inspiring point given by the book. I go through the [reference link](https://andrewsteele.co.uk/ageless/references/) to find more informative details about aging and, most importantly, find out what people have done with computational methods. And it was my first time to know we have already been able to build a [Whole-Cell Computational Model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412007763?via%3Dihub)!

At the same time, I was worried about the low efficiency, long period, and heavily cost of the wet lab experiments (since I want to achieve immortal before death:worried:). I keep on thinking and exploring a more effective way toward my dream.

At the end of the first sophomore semester, after reflection and inspired by *Ageless*, I generate a vague idea to build a model for we human, which enables us to know how a human react to an input drug or treatment. This model should take in those complementary mechanisms into account and think of the whole human holistically. I tried to explain my immature thought to my mentor and he recommended me to learn about AIDD (AI drug design), which is also a project he focuses on.

<h2 id="4">Finding research focus...</h2>
